The modified program is not using Threads.
The program compiles but does not run concurrently. 
Hence, the program execution is sequential. So, all the "Hello World" 
in runnable1 prints first and then all the "Goodbye World".
The original output of HelloWorldTest2 had mixed print outs
of runnable1 and runnable 2 because the program was using Threads for 
the execution of the program.
